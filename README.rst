Created because (rightly *or* wrongly) I'm frustrated with number of dependencies that existing prompt, cli, etc libraries have.  There's some great ideas out there, but I'm not really up for having a page of dependencies install for a library that could be included as part of a cli script.

This is very alpha, experimental, etc, and parts of it will almost certainly change.
